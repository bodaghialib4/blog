This is a **Full-Stack** application.\

I implemented this application only to get familiar with integration of:
  - **Django**
  - **Django REST Framework**
  - **React**
  - **Redux** 

and how deploy them in a **Docker-Composer**.

This project also used **NGINX** as a docker while deploying.

-------------

This project implemented according to below tutorial:
* [How to deploy Django REST Framework and React-Redux application with Docker](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-deploy-django-rest-framework-and-react-redux-application-with-docker-fa902a611abf)
